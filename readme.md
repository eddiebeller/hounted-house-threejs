# Hauted house

## Practice work with primitives.

## I will only use Three.js primitives as geometries, texture, cameras and shadows.

## I will create an elementary house composed of walls, a roof, a door, and some bushes. I will also produce graves in the garden. Instead of visible ghosts made of sheets, i will simply use multicolor lights floating around and passing through the walls and the floor.

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
